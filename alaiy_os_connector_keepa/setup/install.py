Install / migrate plumbing shared by every Alaiy OS connector:

  after_install            -> one-time cleanup on `bench install-app`
  sync_connector_registry  -> (re)register in OS Connector Registry (every migrate)

Heavy setup (custom fields, price lists, ...) intentionally does NOT run on
migrate. It runs once, lazily, the first time the connector is enabled from
its settings form (see the doctype controller's _run_setup()), so installing
the app is cheap and non-destructive until an admin opts in.
